MechaMeal is a 2D level-based game in which the player is required to make the right food combinations.

## Instructions
Drag the options on the dial to switch between MechaMeal's ingredient selections. Select the ingredient which corresponds the ingredient approaching the machine, in order to form the right food combination. Avoid wrong food combinations to prevent damaging MechaMeal.

## Characters
### MechaMeal
MechaMeal is considered as humanity’s greatest technological feat, created to serve and save mankind by serving as the only viable solution to end global hunger.
### Akhaas (You, the Player)
Not much is known about Akhaas as a person. Their age varies - to some they’re old, to others young. Their skin and their speech give no hints as to where they are from. The only thing certain is that they were chosen to learn under world’s greatest inventor: Fadia - and they are now humanity’s only hope of survival.

## Lore
In the year 2100, during the post-Modern era of technological revolution, humanity was at the brink of extinction because of food wastage. Amongst the great minds who tried to solve this environmental crisis rose a Pashtun hero, Fadia, and her creation, MechaMeal, an intelligent machine with the ability to make any recipe without producing any waste.

However, fifty years later, when mother nature had only begun to heal, an unknown  error caused MechaMeal to malfunction. A machine that was once able to make any kind of food could now only use three pairs of ingredients to make a meal. A once automated machine now needed to be operated manually - and there was only one person who could do so; You, Akhaas - Fadia's only disciple.

With her teachings as your only guide, and your fingers your only tool, the fate of the world, and of humanity, lie on your shoulders.
